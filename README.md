#Notifier.js
**Gnome type non-blocking notifications.**

Currently I am only reasing the single file version. Images and CSS are contained within the JavaScript code. 

Look at the [config object](https://github.com/rlemon/Notifier.js/blob/master/Notifier.js#L33), as it is extendable with `Notifier.config( object );`

In the future I will give you a split up version, with seperate CSS and JavaScript files as well as the source Images.

I have a [Demo](http://jsfiddle.net/rlemon/EVWxr/1/) setup @ jsFiddle.net for you to play with.

Please report any bugs or features you would like added.

*this project is a rewrite of https://github.com/Srirangan/notifer.js*
