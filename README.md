#Notifier.js
**Gnome type non-blocking notifications.**

Currently I am only reasing the single file version. Images and CSS are contained within the JavaScript code. 

In the future I will give you a split up version, with seperate CSS and JavaScript files as well as the source Images, However if you are intuitive enough you should be able to split this all out.

I have a [Demo](http://codepen.io/rlemon/full/KDujC) setup @ codepen.io for you to play with.

Please report any bugs or features you would like added.

Enjoy!
