#Notifier.js
**Gnome type non-blocking notifications.**

Currently I am only reasing the single file version. Images and CSS are contained within the JavaScript code. 

Look at the [config object](), as it is extendable with `Notifier.config( object );`

In the future I will give you a split up version, with seperate CSS and JavaScript files as well as the source Images.

Please report any bugs or features you would like added.
